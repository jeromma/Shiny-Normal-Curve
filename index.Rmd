## What is this Shiny app all about?

The purpose of this Shiny app is to allow the user to develop intuition about the normal curve.

It allows you to play around with a normal curve in the following ways:

- Change the mean of the displayed distribution to any integer between -3 and 3 inclusive

- Change the standard deviation of the displayed distribution between .5 and 6 in increments of .05

- Choose the mininum and maximum x values to show on the plot

- Zoom in on a portion of the plot by brushing


## The following R code is evaluated and displayed
```{r}
library (ggplot2)
xvalues <- seq(-6, 6, .1)
yvalues <- dnorm(xvalues, 0, 1)
g <- ggplot(data=data.frame(xvalues, yvalues), aes(x=xvalues, y=yvalues))
g + geom_line() + labs(x="X", y="f(X)")
```
